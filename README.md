Webpack using typescript
1. For webpack config file better to use js file rather than ts.


a.  HtmlWebpackPlugin   :   Used to add js inside index.html
b.  ExtractTextPlugin   :   Used to add css inside head of index.html
c.  CleanWebpackPlugin  :   Used to delete old dist folder before build.
d.  ProvidePlugin       :   Used to provide global variable for jquery and tether(used by bootstrap 4).
e.  CopyWebpackPlugin   :   Used to copy resources from one place to another.


#TODO
1.  Remove bootstrap from index.ts
2.  Hot building
3.  Add angular2
